EVA Assignment 5

1) Setting up the Kitchen

Target:
Get the set-up right

a) Set Transforms
   i)Figure out mean and std value for entire dataset for normalization
     (found to be as mean=0.1308 std=0.3084)
b) Set Data Loader
c) Set Basic Working Code
d) Set Basic Training  & Test Loop
   i) Epochs=15

Results:

Parameters: 6.3M
Best Training Accuracy: 99.97 (Epoch:14)
Best Test Accuracy: 99.22     (Epoch:13)

Analysis:
a)Extremely Heavy Model for such a problem(too many parameters ulimate goal is 10k)
b)Model is over-fitting(train>test and gap between train and test is large)
c)Train is very close to 100 which leaves very less gap (0.03) to improve test by regularization
2) Fixing basic ingeridents and the recipe
3) Cooking
4) Plating and Garnishing
5) Serving Hot!
